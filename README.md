# People who pay more than $5K to influence legislation in California

Data of $5k+ filers for each session, scraped daily from [California Secretary of State](https://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Lobbying/Payments/).

Description of this data from the SoS:
> Persons spending $5,000 or more to influence legislative or administrative action. These filers do not employ a lobbyist and do not contract with a lobbying firm. They file each calendar quarter in which they spend $5,000 or more to influence legislative or administrative action.

It runs on Github Actions once a day to update the data for the current session. If the icon below is green, the last scrape was successful. If the scrape failed the icon will be red.
